                    Aaron is the eldest of Erdutza and Carlos's children. 
                    Unlike his siblings he did not inherit inate magical 
                    abilities from their mother but his knowledge on the 
                    machinations of the sprite world surpasses theirs. Plus,
                    as a cadet in training under the Starlight Court's law
                    enforcement, he's also a more capable fighter.

                            Izarritzian cadet. His mother's primary preference in close combat
                            is ninjitsu, so Aaron knows mostly that.

                            realm after the fall of its capital. These days many go back
                            and forth between Alfheim and the human world so it's useful to
                            know both. As a cadet in training, Aaron has to study how the sprite
                            population participate in society both human and nonhuman.
